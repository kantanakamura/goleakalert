Goroutine leak checker & visualizar

## Background
For beginner gophers, managing goroutines without bugs can be quite challenging, and goroutine leaks often occur. To assist novice gophers in their coding endeavors, I have developed a tool for detecting goroutine leaks and visualizing the changes in the number of goroutines. This tool will greatly facilitate the development of your goroutines.
